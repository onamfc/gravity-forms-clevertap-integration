# CleverTap Integration for Gravity Forms

This plugin automatically sends user data from Gravity Forms submissions to [CleverTap](https://clevertap.com) as a **profile update** and **event** â€” without needing to manually add hooks for each form.

When a user submits a form, the plugin:
- Updates their **CleverTap profile** with custom properties mapped from form fields
- Schedules a **custom event** (configurable per form) to fire **4 minutes later**

---

## Features

- Zero-code setup for form-to-CleverTap syncing
- Flexible property mapping - send any form field to CleverTap as a custom property
- Supports legacy tag functionality for backward compatibility
- Supports custom event name per form
- Uses email as the unique identity
- Deferred (delayed) event sending via WordPress cron
- Optional debug logging to Gravity Forms and PHP logs

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Plugin Configuration

1. Upload the plugin to your WordPress installation
2. Navigate to **Settings > CleverTap Integration**
3. Enter your:
    - CleverTap Account ID
    - CleverTap Passcode
    - (Optional) Enable debug logging

### 2. Form Mapping

This plugin uses a table `wp_ctgf_form_configs` to store form configurations including:
- `form_id`
- `email_field` (the Gravity Forms field ID that holds the email address)
- `tag` (legacy support - value to send to CleverTap as a tag)
- `event_name` (custom event name to send to CleverTap)
- `property_mappings` (JSON array of custom property mappings)
- `active` (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)

Each row represents a complete form configuration.

**Example Configuration:**

| form_id | email_field | tag          | event_name           | property_mappings                                                    | active |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 5       | 1           | Retreat 2025 | Retreat Registration | `[{"property_name":"Phone","form_field":"3"}]` | 1      |

The table also includes:
- `event_mappings` (JSON array of custom event data mappings)

**Example Event Mappings:**
```json
[
  {"event_key":"lead_source","form_field":"5"},
  {"event_key":"campaign","form_field":"6"},
  {"event_key":"referrer","form_field":"7"}
]
```

## Data Sent to CleverTap

### Profile Update

```json
{
  "d": [
    {
      "identity": "user@example.com",
      "type": "profile",
      "profileData": {
        "Phone": "+1234567890",
        "Company": "Acme Corp",
        "Form Signups": {
          "$add": ["Retreat 2025"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** You can now send any form field as a CleverTap property. The legacy tag functionality is still supported for backward compatibility.

### Event (Immediate & Delayed)

```json
{
  "d": [
    {
      "identity": "user@example.com",
      "type": "event",
      "evtName": "Retreat Registration",
      "evtData": {
        "form_id": 5,
        "tag": "Retreat 2025",
        "lead_source": "Google Ads",
        "campaign": "Summer 2024",
        "referrer": "facebook.com"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- Flexible event data mapping system allows sending custom event data
- Supports delayed jobs via `wp_schedule_single_event`
- Logging can be toggled with the `ctgf_enable_logging` option
- Delayed jobs hook into `ctgf_send_delayed_event` with custom event names
- Database schema automatically migrates to support property mappings
- Database schema automatically migrates to support event data mappings
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing tag-based configurations

---

## Debugging

To enable debug logs:
