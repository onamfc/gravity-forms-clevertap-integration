# CleverTap Integration for Gravity Forms

This plugin automatically sends user data from Gravity Forms submissions to [CleverTap](https://clevertap.com) as a **profile update** and **event** â€” without needing to manually add hooks for each form.

When a user submits a form, the plugin:
- Updates their **CleverTap profile** with custom properties mapped from form fields
- Schedules a **custom event** (configurable per form) to fire **4 minutes later**

---

## Features

- Zero-code setup for form-to-CleverTap syncing
- Flexible property mapping - send any form field to CleverTap as a custom property
- Supports legacy tag functionality for backward compatibility
- Supports custom event name per form
- Uses email as the unique identity
- Deferred (delayed) event sending via WordPress cron
- Optional debug logging to Gravity Forms and PHP logs

---

## Database

This plugin uses a table `wp_ctgf_form_configs` to store form configurations including:
- `form_id`
- `email_field` (the Gravity Forms field ID that holds the email address)
- `tag` (legacy support - value to send to CleverTap as a tag)
- `event_name` (custom event name to send to CleverTap)
- `property_mappings` (JSON array of custom property mappings)
- `active` (1 = enabled, 0 = disabled)

Each row represents a complete form configuration.

**Example Configuration:**

| form_id | email_field | tag          | event_name           | property_mappings                                                    | active |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| 5       | 1           | Retreat 2025 | Retreat Registration | `[{"property_name":"Phone","form_field":"3"}]` | 1      |

The table also includes:
- `event_mappings` (JSON array of custom event data mappings)

**Example Event Mappings:**
```json
[
  {"event_key":"lead_source","form_field":"5"},
  {"event_key":"campaign","form_field":"6"},
  {"event_key":"referrer","form_field":"7"}
]
```
